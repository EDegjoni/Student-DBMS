Student Database Management System (Student DBMS)

This project stores data entered in a program into a database, and then displays that information into said program.
It also allows for functionalities from adding entries, to editing their data, to deleting them.
====================================================================================================================
As of this moment, it can only be used through localhost, on the "studentrecords" database.

"ADD" button adds a new entry with the information inputted into the appropriate text fields.
"EDIT" button allows for an entry's data to be altered by changing the text on the text fields after selecting a row.
"DELETE" button lets users completely delete an entry after selecting a row.

All rows must be selected from the table on the right side of the application.
The table automatically updates once an action is taken to alter the database through the application.
====================================================================================================================
Project status:
Functional. All commands work as intended, and the database link is operational. Data gets updated onto the table
and displayed in the application window properly.
====================================================================================================================
Possibility for future updates:
-Adding better ways in which to validate user input to ensure it's not incorrect.
-Attempting to make it work outside of a localhost environment.
-Increasing the number of student information that can be stored.
